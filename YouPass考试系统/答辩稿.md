下面由我来讲解一下项目设计中的亮点与主要功能点，

自动生成试卷与答案的存储编码 Automatic generation of exam papers and code  storage of answers.

刚刚在介绍数据库ER图的时候曾讲到，我们需要解决填空大题与选择题答案用同一类型同一属性的存储问题，我们的解决方案主要在以下几个步骤有所体现。

首先是**发布考试**
教师会在考试前向题库上传题目(题目支持Latex)，然后教师可以向所在课程的所有学生发布考试，并提交考试所要求的单选、多选、填空和大题的数目与分数。

其次进行**检索题目**

后端根据要求的数目与分数将question中按要求随机检索题目，并利用下页的编码方法对其进编码，将标准答案转换成编码与其他信息放到三元联系集当中进行存储。

然后是**传送编码**
 考试开始时前端发送获取考试的信息，按照编码方式对选项list进行编码与其他信息一同传向前端。

下面我们详细介绍一下编解码方式与答案编码存储的设计。

Now let me show the highlights and main function points in the project design. The first is automatically generated test paper and answer storage code. Just when introducing the database ER graph, we need to solve the storage problem of filling the blank and multiple choice questions with the same type and the same attribute, our solution is mainly reflected in the following steps.

The first is the release exam, questions which support Latex format were upload by teacher to the question repository before the exam. Teachers can then publish the exam to all students in their course and submit the number and scores of single, multiple, and fill-in-the-blank questions required for the exam.

Then comes to retrieve the questions, The backend will randomly retrieve the questions according to the required number and score, use the coding method in the next page to encode them, and convert the standard answers into codes then put it into the ternary relation set for storage.

Finally, transfer coding. At the beginning of the test, the frontend sends the information to get the test, and encodes the list of options along with other information. 

Here we introduce the encoding and decoding mode and the design of the storage of encoding answer in detail.

首先对题目答案的编码与处理 。为了解决填空大题与选择题答案在数据库内用同一类型同一属性的存储问题，我们会根据选项的个数生成对应长度由0、1组成的的字符串，1代表选项答案。由于要保障答案顺序的随机性，我们会利用以下编码加密方法来实现选项的加密即随机排列。

该加密编码方法分为三个步骤，共八种方法。在生成题目时会自动生成一个随机数来确定加密方式。

首先我们对原序列串进行前移或后移操作，其次对其进行逆序或原序变换，最后我们选择保持原序列或交换奇偶序列以得到最后的经加密编码的答案串。

下面是一个编解码的实例

Here comes to the coding and processing of the answer to the question. In order to solve the problem that the answers to the fill-in-the-blank questions and multiple choice questions are stored in the database with the same type and same attribute, we will generate the corresponding length string composed of 0 and 1 according to the number of choices, where 1 represents the answer to the choice. To ensure the randomness of the order of the answers, we will use the following encoding encryption method to achieve the encryption of the options, namely random arrangement.

The encryption coding method is divided into three steps, a total of eight methods. A random number will be automatically generated to determine the encryption method.

First, we move forward or backward the original sequence, then reverse it or transform it, and finally we choose to keep the original sequence or swap the odd and even sequence to get the final encrypted answer string.

The following is an example of coding.

------

We assumed the answer to a five-choice multiple question with two choices is "BE". 

We set the BE switch code as 01001 and then select the encoding combination method with the reverse order of the even columns to encrypt to get 00101. In this way, the encoding and encryption of the answer storage are completed. Meanwhile, the List of options will be encrypted in the same way.

It is worth noting that the option coding and encryption interface will only be called when the backend sends data to the frontend or when the frontend sends answers to the backend. The coding sequence stored in the database is always unencrypted, which ensures the rationality and correctness of the system.

最后，我们来到学生进行考试与教师批改阶段。

**发布考试**
学生在加入课程后可以接收到所发布的考试，我们只有达到考试时间时，才会为考试id与课程id设置session，拦截器会对session中数据进行检验，以保障学生只有达到考试开始时间后才可以进行考试。

此外，我们还对那些访问后端登录信息相关的接口设置了登录信息相关联的拦截器，对Session中的用户Id进行检验，并绑定到Request上，即保障了只有登陆后才能获取信息，也方便了后端参数的调用。

学生进入考试可进行答题，答题界面会提示其所选题目、未选题目、题目类型、考试剩余时间、结束时间等其他信息。其中填空题与大题支持Latex格式。学生在提交试卷后无法进入试题界面。

我们做到了考试的断线重连与答案的实时保存。在学生答题的同时每当对答案进行修改都会向后端传送数据，并对答案进行处理与储存，前端每次进入考试界面后会同步获取并展示数据库内的已答题目信息，以做到实时保存。此外，学生答题断线后由于利用session仅需要直接访问url便可进入考试界面以实现断线重连。

最后，教师可选择自动批改试卷或手动批改试卷。

Now it comes to the stage of students taking exams and teachers correcting.

First let's have a look at students taking exams and interceptor. Students can receive the published exam after joining the course. We will set a session for the exam ID and course ID only when the exam time reaches, and the interceptor will check the data in the session to ensure that students can take the exam only after the exam start time reaches.

In addition, we also set up interceptors associated with login information for interfaces that access backend login information, check the user Id in Session, and bind it to Request, which ensures that information can only be obtained after login, and also guarantees the invocation of backend parameters./pəˈræmɪtəz/

When students enter the exam, they can answer the questions. The answer interface will remind them of other information, such as selected questions, unselected questions, question types, remaining time of the exam, and end time. You can see that Fill-in-the-blank questions support Latex format. Students cannot access the question screen after submitting their test papers.

We have achieved the test disconnection reconnect and answer real-time storage. When students answer questions, they will transfer data to the backend and store them whenever they modify the answers. After entering the test interface, the frontend will automatically obtain and display the information of answered questions in the database, so as to achieve real-time storage. In addition, students only need to directly access the URL to enter the examination interface to realize disconnection and reconnection after answering the question.

Finally, teachers can choose to mark the papers automatically or manually.

The above are the highlights and main function points of our project. The following is a demonstration of our project./ˌdemənˈstreɪʃn/
